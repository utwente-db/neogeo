This directory contains a Postgres extension for fast generating pre-aggregate
keys. The functions are called when the PreAggregate.serversideStairwalk
boolean is set to true in Java.

Do:

Note: before running make/make install make sure to copy the *.template.c files into the current directory of the extension. These template files are required!

make 
# this creates the dynamic library

make install
# this installs the library in the postgres installation

make sql
# declare the module in the database you want, you may have to change the
# DATABASE macro in the Makefile for this
