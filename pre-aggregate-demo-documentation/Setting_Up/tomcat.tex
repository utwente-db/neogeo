To visually display an aggregated dataset, a third party application is
used. This application is called GeoServer, GeoServer is an open source
server which can be used to display geospatial data. In order to run
GeoServer a web server is needed. 

Apache Tomcat\footnote{\url{http://tomcat.apache.org/}} has been used for
this purpose.  The use of Tomcat is not required for Stairwalker,
alternative options may also be used as long as it is possible to deploy
WAR files.  Whenever web hosting is mentioned in this manual it will be
assumed Tomcat is being used.

Information about setting up a Tomcat server can be found on the
\href{http://tomcat.apache.org/}{\textsf{Apache Tomcat website}}.
