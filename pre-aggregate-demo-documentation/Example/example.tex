In this section, a concrete example is given to show how to use Stairwalker.
The example runs from creating a pre-aggregation index from a given dataset
to geospacially representing the data using GeoServer. For the example, a
dataset is provided in terms of a .csv file. It concerns an exported list
of tweets sent in the UK and which carry a GPS coordinate.

The result expected in this example can be seen in \Fref{fig:result}.
Different colors represent the number of tweets in a region. The result
only shows the highest granularity. Each tile shows how many tweets are
sent from a location within the tile.  If this layer is combined with a
map, it would be clear that the region of this figure is directly above the
UK.

\subsection{Requirements}
Before showing how to create the given example, all necessary installations
should have been completed and the required files obtained.
The following programs should be installed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item PostgreSQL (\Fref{sec:postgresql})
	\item PosgGIS for a PostgreSQL database (\Fref{sec:postgis})
	\item Tomcat or another web service server (\Fref{sec:tomcat})
	\item GeoServer with extension (\Fref{sec:geoserverinstall})
\end{enumerate}
Also the following files should be at the ready:\footnote{The files can be
found in the \lstinline|RunningExample| directory in the same Git as this
manual.}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The tool to make a pre-aggregate index: Pre-Aggregate-Index tool
		(\Fref{sec:preaggtool})
	\item Configuration file for the tool: \lstinline|runningexample.config.xml|
	\item Sample dataset: \lstinline|RunningExample.csv|
	\item Sample SLD file: \lstinline|RunningExamplSLD.xml|
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore it is useful to have a frontend tool in which the PostgreSQL
database can be managed. During development the tool
pgAdmin\footnote{\url{http://www.pgadmin.org/}} was used.

\subsection{Example Table Setup}

The first step of the process is to have a dataset which to be
aggregated. For this example, a dataset is supplied in the form of a
\lstinline|.csv| file. In order to import this, first create the table in
the database. This can be done with the following SQL query:

\subsubsection{Creating the database}

\begin{lstlisting}
CREATE TABLE runningexample (
	id_str character varying(25),
	tweet text,
	user_name text,
	place_name text,
	time timestamp with time zone,
	reply_to text,
	place_id bigint,
	len bigint,
	coordinates geometry,
	CONSTRAINT enforce_dims_coordinates CHECK ((st_ndims(coordinates) = 2)),
	CONSTRAINT enforce_geotype_coordinates CHECK (((geometrytype(coordinates) = 'POINT'::text) OR (coordinates IS NULL))),
	CONSTRAINT enforce_srid_coordinates CHECK ((st_srid(coordinates) = 4326))
);
\end{lstlisting}

Once the table is created, import the \lstinline|.csv| file into the table.

Note that \lstinline|RunningExample.csv| contains column headers, uses
\lstinline|;| as column seperators and \lstinline|"| as quote seperators.
After the import is done, a pre-aggregate index can be created.

\subsubsection{Creating the Pre-Aggregate Index}
\label{sec:examplePreAggIndex}

An in depth discussion of the use of the pre-aggregate index tool is given
in \Fref{sec:preaggtool}. In the example, only commands will be given with
only brief explanations.

First the pre-aggregate index creation tool needs to be compiled, which can
be done with the command below executed in the
\lstinline|pre-aggregate-tools| directory.
\begin{lstlisting}
mvn package appassembler:assemble
\end{lstlisting}
The next step is to put the pre-aggreate tool config file in the
\lstinline|pre-aggregate-tools| directory. Once this is done, the tool can
be called with the following command. Note some variables need to be set
in the listing below. These are
\lstinline|<database>, <host>, <port>, <pass>, <user>|,
which should be filled according to how PostgreSQL was
set up.
\begin{lstlisting}
target\appassembler\bin\create-pa-index -config runningexample.config.xml -d <database> -dbtype postgresql -h <host> -p <port> -password <pass> -s public -u <user>
\end{lstlisting}
This creates a pre-aggregate index of the dataset. In the database
three new tables are created: The pre-aggregate index named
\lstinline|runningexample_pa| and two help tables which keep track of the
indexes and the axes used by those indexes. All the work on the side of the
database is now done, and the next step is to visualize the dataset using
GeoServer.
