I ruin things with out thinking and don\u2019t do anything till i get hurt myself.  I thought that the grass was greener on the other side but i have come to know thats never the case.  I had someone that made me smile, took care of me when i was sick, listened to what was on my mind, would go out of her way to do something that i needed done.  \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>the perfect woman for Brian Dewey.  I always needed a girl that eyes that made me feel warm inside and she had them and more.  I always told my self i needed a girl that loved and cared for my family, and she had that.  I always told myself that i needed a woman that would be an amazing mother for my children, and she is a perfect mother.  I was looked for a girl that was funny and would put a smile on my face early in the morning when i am grumpy and i found that.  I found a girl that has EVERYTHING for me! But i FUCK IT UP!  I said she alway sounded negative and sad but i never realized that i was the reason for that.  I could have brought a smile to her face more often and made her alot more happy everyday.  but instead i was self centered and had blinders on.  \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>I promised her the world and I haven\u2019t even gave her a city yet.  I forgot the feeling when I focused my day on making her happy and that made me the happiest guy this side of the mississippi.  when i stopped doing that our whole house hold became negative and unhappy.\u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>I sit here at one thirty in the morning knowing that i got class at eight in the morning.  right now that is the least of my worries.  I need to figure out how to over come and also become. People over come large obstacles everyday, alot of small ones but also some very large ones.  I don\u2019t have may large issues in my life.  I only worry that is stuck in my head is about her.  The girl I was going to marry, the girl i was going to spend the rest of my life with, the girl that has loved me for who i am.
