Narcotics Division. And because I lived in Harlem and had full time classes, my AUSA would let me jump on the 3 train with documents that, if leaked, would probably result in the deaths of all named in them. There was a case involving Jamaican marijuana traffickers, and a really specifically important and dangerous document came up missing. (I said it then, and I&#039;ll say it again...I didn&#039;t fucking touch it.)\u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>At this time, I was also doing a lot of Caribbean travel. Jamaica every couple months. Haiti. DR. I&#039;d made friends in these places, had a thirst for travel and danger, and I was FUCKING BORED in law school. \u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>One February day, I was sitting in a hotel room in Port-Au-Prince. I get an urgent email from a dean at my law school, who I then called. &quot;No...I can&#039;t come in for a meeting. I&#039;m in Haiti.&quot; Silence. \u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>&quot;You&#039;re in serious trouble. You might be looking at a federal indictment. They think you destroyed documents intentionally. And why are you currently in the Caribbean???&quot; \u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>Cut to a week later. The law school wrote a letter for me to submit to the US Attorney and promised legal representation from one of the institution&#039;s finest. The US Attorney subsequently took the letter as an admission of guilt to SOMETHING and the lawyer the school stuck me with pulled out, citing conflict of interest and a &quot;how the fuck did this even happen?&quot; attitude. The Federal Defender&#039;s Office took my case, and the fucking ACTUAL Federal Defender, once he was apprised of the details, took me on personally. &quot;I just can&#039;t believe your school would put you in this position,&quot; he said, shaking his head. He flipped through my passport and grilled me on my various excursions. &quot;I believe you...but this is really hard to explain. I THINK...I HOPE...I can keep you from serving any time.&quot; \u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>Full disclosure...I had a legal secretary position lined up on Grand Cayman, and had been communicating with one of those agencies that take people like me, with skills and intelligence, and help them find housing and apply for residency. I figured I was done...and I was 22 years old. \u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>The shit went to some internal conference with my lawyer and a bunch of people from the US Attorney&#039;s Office. They dropped it. I was free. I canceled Cayman, and halfheartedly finished law school. \u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>In our first meeting, the dean said something that really stuck with me. &quot;Why would someone like you even go to law school?&quot; Answer: I shouldn&#039;t have. \u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>(The US Attorney&#039;s Office no longer allows interns to remove any documents from the building.)\u003Cbr \/> \u003Cbr \/>The end. \u003Cbr \/>\u003C\/p>\u003C\/div>","icon":"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yY\/r\/1gBp2bDGEuh.gif","created_time":"2012-12-17T18:04:53+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-17T18:23:38+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"10151313097059510_24863324","from":{"name":"Martin Weingarten","id":"3317845"},"message":"Now, I know why you don't want to be a lawyer.

I?\u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>&quot;EIGHTY-FOUR PERCENT SAY THEY&#039;D NEVER LIE TO A POLLSTER\u003Cbr \/>October 15, 2008\u003Cbr \/>With an African-American running for president this year, there has been a lot of chatter about the &quot;Bradley effect,&quot; allowing the media to wail about institutional racism in America. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>Named after Tom Bradley, who lost his election for California governor in 1982 despite a substantial lead in the polls, the Bradley effect says that black candidates will poll much stronger than the actual election results. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>First of all, if true, this is the opposite of racism: It is fear of being accused of racism. For most Americans, there is nothing more terrifying than the prospect of being called a racist. It&#039;s scarier than flood or famine, terrorist attacks or flesh-eating bacteria. To some, it&#039;s even scarier than &quot;food insecurity.&quot; \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>Political correctness has taught people to lie to pollsters rather than be forced to explain why they&#039;re not voting for the African-American. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>This is how two typical voters might answer a pollster&#039;s question: &quot;Whom do you support for president?&quot; \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>Average Obama voter: &quot;Obama.&quot; (Name of average Obama voter: &quot;Mickey Mouse.&quot;) \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>Average McCain voter: &quot;I&#039;m voting for McCain, but I swear it&#039;s just about the issues. It&#039;s not because Obama&#039;s black. If Barack Obama were a little more moderate -- hey, I&#039;d vote for Colin Powell. But my convictions force me to vote for the candidate who just happens to be white. Say, do you know where I can get Patti LaBelle tickets?&quot; \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In addition to the social pressure to constantly prove you&#039;re not a racist, apparently there is massive social pressure to prove you&#039;re not a Republican. No one is lying about voting for McCain just to sound cool. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>Reviewing the polls printed in The New York Times and The Washington Post in the last month of every presidential election since 1976, I found the polls were never wrong in a friendly way to Republicans. When the polls were wrong, which was often, they overestimated support for the Democrat, usually by about 6 to 10 points. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In 1976, Jimmy Carter narrowly beat Gerald Ford 50.1 percent to 48 percent. And yet, on Sept. 1, Carter led Ford by 15 points. Just weeks before the election, on Oct. 16, 1976, Carter led Ford in the Gallup Poll by 6 percentage points -- down from his 33-point Gallup Poll lead in August. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>Reading newspaper coverage of presidential elections in 1980 and 1984, I found myself paralyzed by the fear that Reagan was going to lose. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In 1980, Ronald Reagan beat Carter by nearly 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent. In a Gallup Poll released days before the election on Oct. 27, it was Carter who led Reagan 45 percent to 42 percent. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In 1984, Reagan walloped Walter Mondale 58.8 percent to 40 percent, -- the largest electoral landslide in U.S. history. But on Oct. 15, The New York Daily News published a poll showing Mondale with only a 4-point deficit to Reagan, 45 percent to 41 percent. A Harris Poll about the same time showed Reagan with only a 9-point lead. The Oct. 19 New York Times\/CBS News Poll had Mr. Reagan ahead of Mondale by 13 points. All these polls underestimated Reagan&#039;s actual margin of victory by 6 to 15 points. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In 1988, George H.W. Bush beat Michael Dukakis by a whopping 53.4 percent to 45.6 percent. A New York Times\/CBS News Poll on Oct. 5 had Bush leading the Greek homunculus by a statistically insignificant 2 points -- 45 percent to 43 percent. (For the kids out there: Before it became a clearinghouse for anti-Bush conspiracy theories, CBS News was considered a credible journalistic entity.) \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>A week later -- or one tank ride later, depending on who&#039;s telling the story -- on Oct. 13, Bush was leading Dukakis in The New York Times Poll by a mere 5 points. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>Admittedly, a 3- to 6-point error is not as crazily wrong as the 6- to 15-point error in 1984. But it&#039;s striking that even small &quot;margin of error&quot; mistakes never seem to benefit Republicans. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In 1992, Bill Clinton beat the first President Bush 43 percent to 37.7 percent. (Ross Perot got 18.9 percent of Bush&#039;s voters that year.) On Oct. 18, a Newsweek Poll had Clinton winning 46 percent to 31 percent, and a CBS News Poll showed Clinton winning 47 percent to 35 percent. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>So in 1992, the polls had Clinton 12 to 15 points ahead, but he won by only 5.3 points. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In 1996, Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole 49 percent to 40 percent. And yet on Oct. 22, 1996, The New York Times\/CBS News Poll showed Clinton leading by a massive 22 points, 55 percent to 33 percent. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In 2000, which I seem to recall as being fairly close, the October polls accurately described the election as a virtual tie, with either Bush or Al Gore 1 or 2 points ahead in various polls. But in one of the latest polls to give either candidate a clear advantage, The New York Times\/CBS News Poll on Oct. 3, 2000, showed Gore winning by 45 percent to 39 percent. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/>In the last presidential election the polls were surprisingly accurate -- not including the massively inaccurate Election Day exit poll. In the end, Bush beat John Kerry 50.7 percent to 48.3 percent in 2004. Most of the October polls showed the candidates in a dead-heat, with Bush 1 to 3 points ahead. So either pollsters got a whole lot better starting in 2004, or Democrats stole more votes in that election than we even realized.&quot; \u003C\/p>\u003C\/div>","icon":"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yY\/r\/1gBp2bDGEuh.gif","created_time":"2008-10-18T19:58:59+0000","updated_time":"2008-10-18T19:58:59+0000"},{"id":"29106474509","from":{"name":"Lindsey Snell","id":"10909213"},"subject":"Why Obama supporters are fucking morons.","message":"\u003Cdiv>\u003Cp>Someone once told me that people get the government they deserve.

There is now the beginning of a generalized run on the banking system of these economies; a collapse of the shadow banking system, i.e. those non-banks (broker dealers, non-bank mortgage lenders, SIV and conduits, hedge funds, money market funds, private equity firms) that, like banks, borrow short and liquid, are highly leveraged and lend and invest long and illiquid, and are thus at risk of a run on their short-term liabilities; and now a roll-off of the short term liabilities of the corporate sectors that may lead to widespread bankruptcies of solvent but illiquid financial and non-financial firms. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>On the real economic side, all the advanced economies representing 55\u0025 of global GDP (U.S., Eurozone, UK, other smaller European countries, Canada, Ja pan, Australia, New Zealand, Japan) entered a recession even before the massive financial shocks that started in the late summer made the liquidity and credit crunch even more virulent and will thus cause an even more severe recession than the one that started in the spring. So we have a severe recession, a severe financial crisis and a severe banking crisis in advanced economies. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>There was no decoupling among advanced economies and there is no decoupling but rather recoupling of the emerging market economies with the severe crisis of the advanced economies. By the third quarter of this year global economic growth will be in negative territory signaling a global recession. The recoupling of emerging markets was initially limited to stock markets that fell even more than those of advanced economies as foreign investors pulled out of these markets; but then it spread to credit markets and money markets and currency markets bringing to the surface the vulnerabilities of many financial systems and corporate sectors that had experienced credit booms and that had borrowed short and in foreign currencies. Countries with large current account deficits and\/or large fiscal deficits and with large short-term foreign currency liabilities and borrowings have been the most fragile. But even the better performing ones \u2013 like the BRICs club of Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 are now at risk of a hard landing. Trade and fin ancial and currency and confidence channels are now leading to a massive slowdown of growth in emerging markets with many of them now at risk not only of a recession but also of a severe financial crisis. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>The crisis was caused by the largest leveraged asset bubble and credit bubble in the history of humanity where excessive leveraging and bubbles were not limited to housing in the U.S. but also to housing in many other countries and excessive borrowing by financial institutions and some segments of the corporate sector and of the public sector in many and different economies: an housing bubble, a mortgage bubble, an equity bubble, a bond bubble, a credit bubble, a commodity bubble, a private equity bubble, a hedge funds bubble are all now bursting at once in the biggest real sector and financial sector deleveraging since the Great Depression. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>At this point the recession train has left the station; the financial and banking crisis train has left the station. The delusion that the U.S. and advanced economies contraction would be short and shallow \u2013 a V-shaped six month recession \u2013 has been replaced by the certainty that this will be a long and protracted U-shaped recession that may last at least two years in the U.S. and close to two years in most of the rest of the world. And given the rising risk of a global systemic financial meltdown, the probability that the outcome could become a decade long L-shaped recession \u2013 like the one experienced by Japan after the bursting of its real estate and equity bubble \u2013 cannot be ruled out. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>And in a world where there is a glut and excess capacity of goods while aggregate demand is falling, soon enough we will start to worry about deflation, debt deflation, liquidity traps and what monetary policy makers should do to fight deflation when policy rates get dangerously close to zero. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>At this point the risk of an imminent stock market crash \u2013 like the one-day collapse of 20\u0025 plus in U.S. stock prices in 1987 \u2013 cannot be ruled out as the financial system is breaking down, panic and lack of confidence in any counterparty is sharply rising and the investors have totally lost faith in the ability of policy authorities to control this meltdown. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>This disconnect between more and more aggressive policy actions and easings, and greater and greater strains in the financial market is scary. When Bear Stearns\u2019 creditors were bailed out to the tune of $30 bn in March, the rally in equity, money and credit markets lasted eight we eks; when in July the U.S. Treasury announced legislation to bail out the mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie, the rally lasted four weeks; when the actual $200 billion rescue of these firms was undertaken and their $6 trillion liabilities taken over by the U.S. government, the rally lasted one day, and by the next day the panic had moved to Lehman\u2019s collapse; when AIG was bailed out to the tune of $85 billion, the market did not even rally for a day and instead fell 5\u0025. Next when the $700 billion U.S. rescue package was passed by the U.S. Senate and House, markets fell another 7\u0025 in two days as there was no confidence in this flawed plan and the authorities. Next, as authorities in the U.S. and abroad took even more radical policy actions between October 6th and October 9th (payment of interest on reserves, doubling of the liquidity support of banks, extension of credit to the seized corporate sector, guarantees of bank deposits, plans to recapitalize banks, coordinated monetary policy easing, etc.), the stock markets and the credit markets and the money markets fell further and further and at accelerated rates day after day all week, including another 7\u0025 fall in U.S. equities today. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>When in markets that are clearly way oversold, even the most radical policy actions don\u2019t provide rallies or relief to market participants. You know that you are one step away from a market c rash and a systemic financial sector and corporate sector collapse. A vicious circle of deleveraging, asset collapses, margin calls, and cascading falls in asset prices well below falling fundamentals, and panic is now underway. \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>At this point severe damage is done and one cannot rule out a systemic collapse and a global depression. It will take a significant change in leadership of economic policy and very radical, coordinated policy actions among all advanced and emerging market economies to avoid this economic and financial disaster. Urgent and immediate necessary actions that need to be done globally (with some variants across countries depending on the severity of the problem and the overall resources available to the sovereigns) include: \r\u003Cbr \/>  \r\u003Cbr \/>\u2022\tanother rapid round of policy rate cuts of the order of at least 150 basis points on average globally; \r\u003Cbr \/>\u2022\ta temporary blanket guarantee of all deposits while a triage between insolvent financial institutions that need to be shut down and distressed but solvent institutions that need to be partially nati onalized with injections of public capital is made; \r\u003Cbr \/>\u2022\ta rapid reduction of the debt burden of insolvent households preceded by a temporary freeze on all foreclosures; \r\u003Cbr \/>\u2022\tmassive and unlimited provision of liquidity to solvent financial institutions; \r\u003Cbr \/>\u2022\tpublic provision of credit to the solvent parts of the corporate sector to avoid a short-term debt refinancing crisis for solvent but illiquid corporations and small businesses; \r\u003Cbr \/>\u2022\ta massive direct government fiscal stimulus packages that includes public works, infrastructure spending, unemployment benefits, tax rebates to lower income households and provision of grants to strapped and crunched state and local government; \r\u003Cbr \/>\u2022\ta rapid resolution of the banking problems via triage, public recapitalization of financial institutions and reduction of the debt burden of distressed households and borrowers; \r\u003Cbr \/>\u2022\tan agreement between lender and creditor countries running current account surpluses and borrowing, and debtor countries running current account deficits to maintain an orderly financing of deficits and a recycling of the surpluses of creditors to avoid a disorderly adjustment of such imbalances.\r\u003Cbr \/>\r\u003Cbr \/>At this point, anything short of these radical and coordinated actions may lead to a market crash, a global systemic financial meltdown and to a global depression. The time to act is now as all the policy officials of the world are meeting this weekend in Washington at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings. \r\u003Cbr \/>\u003C\/p>\u003C\/div>","icon":"https:\/\/fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yY\/r\/1gBp2bDGEuh.gif","created_time":"2008-10-10T16:21:00+0000","updated_time":"2008-10-10T16:21:00+0000"},{"id":"24681769509","from":{"name":"Lindsey Snell","id":"10909213"},"subject":"White people continue to ruin Harlem in my absence.","message":"\u003Cdiv>\u003Cb>It was after 4 am on the last night of my most recent visit to NYC.
