It would be very hard for a man to live with me, unless he\u2019s terribly strong. And if he\u2019s stronger than I, I\u2019m the one who can\u2019t live with him. \u2026 I\u2019m neither smart nor stupid, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a run-of-the-mill person. I\u2019ve been in business without being a businesswoman, I\u2019ve loved without being a woman made only for love. The one man I\u2019ve loved, I think, will remember me, on earth or in heaven, because men always remember a woman who caused them concern and uneasiness. I\u2019ve done my best, in regard to people and to life with a taste for justice, love and forgiveness","quotes":"Every saint has a past, every sinner has a future...\n\u200e\"We are not held back by the love we didn't receive in the past, but by the love we're not extending in the present.\"\n- Marianne Williamson\nYou can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went, You can swear and curse the fates, but when it comes to the end, you have to let go\nTell everyone you know ;\n'My happiness depends on me, so you're off the hook.\" And then demonstrate it. Be happy, no matter what they're doing. Practice feeling good, no matter what. And before you know it, you will not give anyone else responsibility for the way you feel-and then, you'll love them all. The only reason you don't love them, is because you're using them as your excuse to not feel good.\"","work":[{"employer":{"id":"383713282639","name":"Deco Models"},"location":{"id":"108260802527498","name":"Miami Beach, Florida"},"position":{"id":"414536945309577","name":"Marketing director, head booker"},"start_date":"0000-00"},{"employer":{"id":"110611632301090","name":"Karan Investments"}},{"employer":{"id":"267312783366599","name":"Eden Roc Renaissance Miami Beach"}},{"employer":{"id":"290412794350320","name":"Augest Pictures"}}],"favorite_athletes":[{"id":"176063032413299","name":"Leo Messi"},{"id":"64822581025","name":"Rafa Nadal"}],"education":[{"school":{"id":"110719888974731","name":"Latvian Academy of Culture"},"type":"College"},{"school":{"id":"104045412964458","name":"University of Latvia"},"type":"College"}],"gender":"female","interested_in":["male"],"locale":"en_US","languages":[{"id":"107589932597465","name":"Swedish"},{"id":"105588579475939","name":"Latvian"},{"id":"106059522759137","name":"English"},{"id":"112624162082677","name":"Russian"}],"updated_time":"2013-04-04T01:00:08+0000"}
