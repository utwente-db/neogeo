Created by Ivan Linton Jr. aka \"Inspekta\" and Francis Forbes aka \"Franchise\" this Miami based company started early 2008 and has been creating mass hysteria in the Miami-Dade community ever since. This online based retail store has already reached out to the world and now is looking to give back to Miami and the U.S. market by putting our own Square Rootz Clothing Co. retail store here in Miami,other major cities and major retail stores near you. The theme is Japanese and Hip Hop based but with the innovation and creativity of both Inspekta and Franchise, the clothes we make cater to all likes and all walks of life from the young to the old. We conqured music, now we gonna conquer fashion in all aspects of the game.
