I thoroughly believe there is a 'who I am' and a 'who I was\". I have a voice and opinions that I don't mind being heard. I will forever and always stand up for what I feel is right, even if no ones by my side. I'd say I'm sarcastic, or crude, or funny - but really I'm just an asshole. However my heart is big and my intentions are always in the right place. I'm a good listener; please feel free to use that to your benefit.","work":[{"employer":{"id":"234516607392","name":"Windsor Place"},"location":{"id":"108796165810661","name":"Coffeyville, Kansas"},"position":{"id":"137051956330556","name":"CNA"},"start_date":"0000-00"}],"sports":[{"id":"109446562415595","name":"Volleyball"}],"favorite_teams":[{"id":"129494626317","name":"Denver Broncos"}],"education":[{"school":{"id":"106335336069074","name":"Independence High School"},"year":{"id":"201638419856163","name":"2011"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"105633562803525","name":"Independence Community College"},"type":"College"}],"gender":"female","relationship_status":"Single","locale":"en_US","languages":[{"id":"111735208843636","name":"Chinese"},{"id":"110343528993409","name":"Spanish"},{"id":"113153272032690","name":"Italian"}],"updated_time":"2013-02-16T21:57:31+0000"}
