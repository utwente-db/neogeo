Traveling, acting and screen writing are my passions.  My grandfather, Max Wenig, from Vienna, Austria once told me that the greatest gift in life is to be able to make a fine living doing what you love and that there is nothing more fulfilling and rewarding in life other than real love.  Those words live and breathe within my soul and I strive to follow in his footsteps.  We are like minded artists who appreciate life, beauty and everything this crazy world has to offer.  He was an inspirational and motivational man in my life.  G d bless his precious soul.","quotes":"\"Dance like there's nobody watching.  Love like you'll never get hurt.
