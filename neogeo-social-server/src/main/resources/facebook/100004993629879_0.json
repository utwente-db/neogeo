I have a relatively strong introverted streak, but I can carry a conversation and do enjoy meeting people. However, large crowds and generic cocktail party socializing are not my cup of tea. I like social events with my friends, but that tends to be meeting individually or in smaller groups. \n\nTravel and music make my eyes sparkle. I travel most often in the summer, then spend the fall and winter planning the next trip. Usually by the time spring rolls around, I end up going somewhere completely different anyway. But I like to daydream about places to visit.\n\nI listen to quite a bit of music, so I keep my ears open for music from around the world and often attend concerts. My eyes sparkle when I find some new artists or interesting music.","quotes":"Jesus is Lord, ever since I've sided with Jesus I have been undefeated.","work":[{"employer":{"id":"115382895163597","name":"Self Employed (Business)"}}],"favorite_teams":[{"id":"5768707450","name":"MLB"}],"favorite_athletes":[{"id":"322741974506420","name":"Mike Rowlands - MJ"}],"education":[{"school":{"id":"105641092803561","name":"California High School"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"113681108642514","name":"Manchester Business School"},"type":"College"}],"gender":"female","relationship_status":"Single","locale":"en_US","languages":[{"id":"106059522759137","name":"English"},{"id":"312525296370","name":"Spanish"},{"id":"105673612800327","name":"German"},{"id":"108083115891989","name":"Portugu\u00eas"}],"updated_time":"2013-03-23T23:56:46+0000"}
