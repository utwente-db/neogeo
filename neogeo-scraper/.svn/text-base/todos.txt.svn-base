Bugs:
Major:
- TransientObjectException keeps popping up every now and then

Minor:
- Admin panel not working for scraper:
  - Progress indicator is incorrect (~ 0.15 while over halfway the categories)
  - No harvested results are shown in browser
- No table headers get sent in proxy test response
- Error message in log "Bad value for int": unclear why, other behaviour is correct

New features:
Must haves:
- Filter out search result items (1 - ...)
- POI duplicate detection
- Multiple addresses for one detail page (e.g. http://www.enschedesezwembaden.nl/default.asp?id=1122162034)

Nice to haves:
- Add new features to address detector, use model inspection
- Improve stability xPaths by finding several xPaths and ranking
- Translate search categories and field names (see TranslationTest)

Polishing:
- Let the ModelEntity be filled on the way (name, sourceUrl, etc)
- Hibernate mapping resources loaded with wildcard
- Only one location for hibernate.cfg.xml
- Make workflows thread-safe (use workflowexecution for the not thread-safe part) 

Maintainability:
- Code generator for classes, daos, hbm
