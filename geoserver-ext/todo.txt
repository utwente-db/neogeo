1) it is at the moment hard coded that the underlying database supports the time dimension; 
this must be dynamic

2) if you reach the boundaries of the dataset, the bbox of the map is rest to the bbox 
of the dataset WITHOUT reducing the number of grid cells. As a consequence when zooming out
a lot the grid cells get very tiny. Adjust BBox and number of grid cells.

3) handle getFeatureInfo: currently the getFeatureInfo has a tiny BBox, which seems to
correspond to the point the mouse is pointing to; however, in our aggregation view we
have to query the cell where the mouse is pointing to.
